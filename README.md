# Six-Degrees-of-Kevin-Bacon
The popular game “Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon” involves linking a member of Hollywood, like an actor or a director, to another member of Hollywood, usually Kevin Bacon, in six steps or less. This program provides an algorithmic way of determining if such a connection exists and finds the fewest number of degrees between two members of Hollywood so that players of the game will know if their guess was correct.
Here is a video tutorial of how to use this program once installed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fFheV1wRGw
